# search_engine
Ambatovy search engine - v1

The file system for the program to work is as follows:

\--resources
\--01_SDS
\--02_Label
\--03_MHB
libstdc++-6.dll
Qt5Core.dll
Qt5Gui.dll
Qt5Widgets.dll
search_engine.exe

Inside the resource folder are the files loaded by the app, do not rename those, leave them in the resources folder

Inside 01_SDS the files must follow this naming convention: S_0001.pdf, S_0002.pdf, S_0003.pdf and onwards
Inside 02_Label the files must follow this naming convention: S_0001.pdf, L_0002.pdf, S_0003.pdf and onwards
Inside 03_MHB the files must follow this naming convention: S_0001.pdf, M_0002.pdf, S_0003.pdf and onwards
